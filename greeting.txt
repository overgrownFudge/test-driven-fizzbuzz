// 1. describe() declares a test suite, which is a grouping of tests. Its first argument is a name, and the second is a function containing one or more tests.
// 2. it() declares a test. Its first argument is a name, and the second is a function with the actual test code.
// 3. expect() creates an assertion. It takes a single argument, typically a value generated by the code being tested, and returns an object that exposes a set of matcher functions.
// 4. toBe() a matcher that performs a strict equality test between the value being tested (the expect() argument) and the expected value (its own argument).

// the test suite name ("greeting()") is a noun. The test name ("says hello") is a verb. Together, they form a complete sentence describing the functionality covered by the test ("greeting() says hello").
